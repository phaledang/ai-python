Steps I followed
For simplicity, I ran the following commands on Ubuntu 20.04 to setup Docker Engine on my machine.

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
 apt-transport-https \
 ca-certificates \
 curl \
 gnupg \
 lsb-release

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo \
 "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
 $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

sudo service docker start

sudo groupadd docker

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

newgrp docker

Run Docker Commands
At this point you should have a fully operation Docker Engine installed running on Ubuntu under WSL2. You can check this by trying to run the hello-world image from Docker Hub.
docker run hello-world
